## Introduction

Monitoring workersâ€™ proximities to avoid human-machine collisions has aroused great concern in construction safety management. Existing methods are either too laborious and costly to apply extensively or lack spatial perception for accurate monitoring. This study proposes a novel framework for proximity monitoring using only an ordinary 2D camera to realize human-machine collision warning, which integrates a monocular 3D object detection model and a post-processing classification module to identify four proximity categories: Dangerous, Potentially Dangerous, Concerned, and Safe. A virtual dataset containing 22,000 images with 3D bounding box annotation is constructed and publicly released to facilitate the system development and evaluation. Experiments show that the implemented system is real-time and camera carrier-independent, achieving an F1 of roughly 0.8 within 50 meters. This study preliminarily reveals the potential and feasibility of proximity monitoring using only a 2D surveillance camera, providing a new promising and affordable way for early warning of human-machine collisions.
